## Smart Factory Semiconductor Process Optimization
#### **Background and Objectives**
- The objective of this project was to enhance anomaly detection performance in a smart factory setting, specifically focusing on optimizing semiconductor manufacturing processes.
- The goal was to identify and predict defective products, thereby improving overall product quality.

#### **Project Overview**
- The project aimed to leverage the advantages of smart factories and the unique characteristics of semiconductor manufacturing processes.
- Various comprehensive processes were undertaken to construct an anomaly detection model, with the ultimate aim of predicting defective products and implementing differentiated quality management strategies.

#### **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
- Data consisted of eight features, including temperature and humidity, measured through sensors.
- Preprocessing involved handling missing values and considering correlations among features.

#### **Modeling and Performance Evaluation**
- After experimenting with multiple models, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) demonstrated superior performance. The MLP model was fine-tuned, leading to optimal results in testing as well.

#### **Results and Conclusion**
- Visualization analysis clearly highlighted distinctions between acceptable and defective products. The implemented classification algorithms successfully detected defects in advance. There is potential to reduce the defect rate by introducing automated processes and additional inspections.

#### **Future Research Directions**
- Future research should focus on refining the imputation methods for missing values, optimizing hyperparameters, and enhancing the model by considering inter-feature dependencies. Additionally, there is potential for constructing anomaly detection processes utilizing chemical reaction data.

#### **Conclusion**
- This project achieved successful detection and prediction of defects in a smart factory environment. It is anticipated that these findings will significantly contribute to future optimization efforts in the manufacturing process.


## Medical_Cost_Prediction
#### **Title:** Predicting Personal Medical Expenses (Insurance) Project

#### **Overview:** In this analysis project, an individual-specific medical cost prediction model is constructed and evaluated by considering factors such as age, gender, obesity, number of childbirths, residence, and smoking status.  
#### Purpose:  
- Through predicting medical expenses based on social and physical individual information, individuals can forecast their medical costs, preventing overpayment and allowing them to pay corresponding insurance premiums directly. Additionally, insurance companies can understand trends in insurance cost changes and plan customized products accordingly.
1. **Data Collection:** Follow the data collection path below (Kaggle dataset).  
2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
- Check for missing values in all columns and handle them through removal or imputation.  
- Perform Label Encoding for columns with string data types.  
- Remove rows where negative values are present in any column.  
- Identify outliers based on criteria: age: 100 years, children: 10, and remove corresponding rows.  
- Apply One-Hot Encoding for necessary columns.  
  
#### **3. Modeling:**  

- Analyze the distribution of variables with Charges and select feature columns accordingly.  
- Split the preprocessed dataset into an 80:20 ratio.  
- Train/Test the data using models such as AdaBoost, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Penalized Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGB Regression, etc.  
- If possible, find optimal parameters using GridSearchCV.  

#### **4. Model Evaluation and Selection:**  
- Select an evaluation metric (MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE) to calculate scores and choose the best-performing model.
