### Main Objective
- The objective of this project was to analyze weather data sourced from the 'Aerial Bombing Operations of World War Two' dataset.
- The focus was on weather station locations and climate information recorded on specific dates.
- By employing various statistical techniques and time series models, the project aimed to gain insights into historical weather patterns and predict future temperatures.
- The analysis holds significance in identifying stable time periods unaffected by World War Two aerial bombing operations, enabling strategic planning based on weather conditions.

### Analysis Steps:
### Data Preprocessing:
- The initial step involved meticulous data preprocessing.
- The dataset was loaded and carefully cleaned, addressing missing values to ensure the reliability of subsequent analyses.
- Visualizations were employed to explore data characteristics, with a specific focus on data related to Seoul, providing a localized perspective.

### Statistical Testing:
- **Unit Root Test:** Unit root tests were conducted to confirm the stationarity of the data.
- **ACF:** Autocorrelation analysis was employed to understand the data's autocorrelation structure, providing valuable insights into its behavior over time.
### Analytical Techniques
- Primarily, time series data was analyzed using Moving Average (MA) and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) models, applied using Brightics Studio.

### Modeling Approaches:
#### Moving Average (MA) and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) Models:
- MA and EWMA models were implemented to analyze the time series data. EWMA, with its adaptive nature to recent variations, showcased superior accuracy. A comparative analysis of MA and EWMA models highlighted the latterâ€™s effectiveness in capturing historical weather trends.

#### ARIMA and Holt-Winters Models:
- ARIMA models were manually configured, but the process revealed the need for parameter tuning to improve performance.
- Auto ARIMA, although an improvement, fell short compared to the Holt-Winters model.
- The Holt-Winters model, leveraging its ability to capture trends and seasonality, emerged as the most suitable choice.

### Analysis and Results:
- Comparative metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) were employed to assess model performance.
- The Holt-Winters model demonstrated remarkable accuracy, outperforming other models. 
- Its ability to predict future temperatures accurately makes it invaluable for strategic planning, allowing stakeholders to identify stable time periods unaffected by historical events.

### Conclusion and Implications:
- In conclusion, the comprehensive analysis of weather data from World War Two aerial bombing operations provides valuable insights into historical weather patterns.
- The Holt-Winters model, identified as the most accurate, equips decision-makers with a powerful tool for predicting future temperatures.
- This knowledge is instrumental in strategic planning, enabling the identification of stable time periods for various activities.
- The implications are vast, ranging from agricultural planning to urban development, ensuring decisions are informed by historical weather trends, enhancing their efficacy and resilience.
- Based on the analysis results, future temperature predictions and strategic planning can be conducted, facilitating informed decision-making.

#### Data Loading and Combination
- Load and join related processes.
- Join and Distinct Functions Usage
  - Age/Gender/Telecom, Securities/1st Financial Sector
### Encoder Process

#### Label Encoder
- Convert multiple variables into numeric values within a single column.
- For example, create an index named 'Name_index' and categorize 'Kim Bros' as 0, 'Seo Bros' as 1, and 'Choi Bros' as 2.
#### Filter 
- Filter based on the count of top variables for Metropolitan Area / Internet Service Provider, considering it for OneHotEncoder.
#### OneHotEncoder
- Generate columns for multiple variables and fill the columns with 1 if applicable, and 0 otherwise (e.g., Name_0, Name_1, Name_2).
  
#### Data Visualization for EDA Analysis
- Analyze gender distribution among suspects, monthly financial fraud cases, age group-wise fraud cases, and prominent banks/financial institutions.  
#### **1. Gender:**  
- In the case of suspects (perpetrators), males account for approximately 80% of the total, indicating that males are significantly more involved in financial fraud-related activities.
#### **2. Monthly Financial Fraud Cases:** 
- In descending order, the months with the highest number of financial fraud cases are August, followed by September, July, and March.
- The data shows a balanced distribution across months, indicating there is no significant imbalance.
- Consequently, it can be inferred that financial fraud occurrences are not strongly correlated with specific months.
#### **3. Financial Fraud Cases by Birth Year Range**
- When categorized by birth year range (age groups), individuals born in the 2000s, specifically late teens to early twenties, experienced the highest number of financial fraud incidents.
- Following this group, those born in the 1990s and 1980s had the next highest occurrences, in that order.
#### **4. Bank Name / Bank Code**
- When examined by bank name (bank code), KakaoBank dominates, accounting for approximately 22% of the cases.
- While the high prevalence of KakaoBank might be influenced by the large number of users, knowing the actual user counts could reveal which financial institutions are more susceptible to fraud.

### Modeling Process
#### Classification Train
- Use 'Bank Name' as the Y variable, split the data, and group 'Bank Name' by applying group by.
#### Classification Predict
- Measure predictions as probabilities for multi-class classification. Set Shuffle Type as index.
#### EvaluateÂ Classification
- Compare metrics such as accuracy and F1 score between 'Bank Name' and predictions.

### Conclusion - Financial Fraud Analysis & Expected Benefits
#### Societal Impact
- With the advancement of IT, the importance of financial security in society has increased.
- This analysis aims to analyze types of financial crimes and prevent them in advance, contributing to reducing social harm and enhancing stability.
#### Corporate Perspective
- Each bank aims to strengthen security and prevent financial fraud.
- By securing data from non-victims, banks can offer better products, such as insurance related to financial fraud or preventive measures.
#### Individuals
- Individuals can enhance their personal security by understanding which financial institutions are more vulnerable.
- Providing numerical information about financial crimes enables the dissemination of knowledge, allowing individuals to take necessary precautions.
